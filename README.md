## docker-manager
docker-manager is a web user interface for Docker and Docker Registry.
This project is currently in development, many features are still missing and are under development. 
It is somewhat influenced by _startbootstrap-sb-admin_ and _dockerui_ projects (thanks!).

The project itself consists of several sections, each section has its own functionality and corresponds to a section in Docker or Docker Registry:
##### Dashboard (landing page)
![Dashboard](/dashboard.png)

##### Images

There are helpful tooltips / popovers in each section based on the official docker documentation, so you basically learn
along the way on what docker is

Forks and contributions are more than welcome!
